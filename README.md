# VijosDGZX
My senior high school - Jiangsu Dagang High School (short for DGZX)  
It has a Vijos system for students who are willing to attend NOIP comptetion.  
As one of the outstanding players of DGZX, I solved some of the questions on Vijos.  
In order to share my experience and make some contribution to my school, I decited to upload these source codes.  
I sincerely hope these codes can offer some help. 
 
At last, I maintain that these codes are under **GPLv3**, which means you can use them for free, with my **ATTRIBUTION(署名)** & **NO commercial using(非商业用途)**  

Best wished!
